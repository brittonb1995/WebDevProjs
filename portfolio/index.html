                    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
                    <p>I am an aspiring software developer. I am from Flower Mound, Texas, and I have a degree in physics.</p>
                    <p>I originally wanted to be an astrophysicist, but I got worn out from school and astrophysics
                        is harder than it seems to get into.</p>
                </article id="past-experiences">
                    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
                    <p>I have lived in the Dallas, TX area all of my life. I played in my high school marching band
                    and won multiple state titles in marching band.</p>
                    <p>I have visited many different states outside of Texas, but my favorites include New Mexico,
                        Oregon, and Nevada</p>
                <article id="hobbies">
                    <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
                    <p>I enjoy playing video games! My favorite genres include RPG, multiplayer shooters, and Madden!</p>
                    <p>I also enjoy watching football. I especially love watching my Fightin' Texas Aggies and
                    the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
